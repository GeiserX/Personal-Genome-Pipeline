# Step 6: ClinVar Pathogenic Variant Screening

## What This Does
Intersects your sample VCF against the ClinVar database of known pathogenic variants, identifying any positions where your genome carries a clinically reported disease variant.

## Why
ClinVar is the most widely used public database of clinically reported variants. This screen catches pathogenic SNPs and indels that have been submitted by clinical labs — carrier status, dominant disease risk, and pharmacogenomic flags. Note that ClinVar entries vary in evidence quality (see star ratings in [interpreting-results.md](interpreting-results.md)).

## Tool
- **bcftools norm**, **isec** and **annotate** — split and left-align both files, keep the sample's records whose allele is in ClinVar, and copy ClinVar's gene, significance and review status onto them

## Docker Image
- `BCFTOOLS_IMAGE`

Pinned in `versions.env`; [Image versions](versions.md) lists the current tag.

## Prerequisites
- Sample VCF from DeepVariant (step 3)
- Reference FASTA and its `.fai`: `reference/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta` (used to left-align indels)
- `clinvar_pathogenic_chr.vcf.gz` from reference setup (step 00) — chr-prefixed, filtered to Pathogenic/Likely_pathogenic only

## Command
```bash
export GENOME_DIR=/path/to/data
./scripts/06-clinvar-screen.sh <sample_name>

# For long-read Clair3 output:
VCF_DIR=vcf_clair3 ./scripts/06-clinvar-screen.sh <sample_name>
```

### What the Script Does

1. Checks that the sample VCF and the ClinVar file share contig names (`bcftools index -s`). A ClinVar file named `1, 2, ...` against a `chr1, chr2, ...` VCF stops the step with an error instead of reporting zero hits.
2. Builds `clinvar/clinvar_pathogenic_chr.norm.vcf.gz` beside the ClinVar file the first time, and again whenever the source file is newer: multiallelic records split (`bcftools norm -m -any`) and indels left-aligned against the reference. Every sample then reuses it. The Nextflow module reuses this file when it sits beside the `--clinvar` file and is newer; otherwise it normalises ClinVar inside the task.
3. Filters the sample VCF to PASS records. If the VCF has no PASS record at all (callers that leave FILTER as `.`), it uses `-f .,PASS` instead and prints a notice saying so. If no record is left, the step stops with an error.
4. Splits and left-aligns the sample the same way. `bcftools isec` matches only identical REF/ALT, so a pathogenic allele inside a multiallelic record (genotype `1/2`) is found only after this split.
5. Keeps the sample's records whose allele is in ClinVar (`bcftools isec -n=2 -w1`) and copies ClinVar's `ID`, `GENEINFO`, `CLNSIG` and `CLNREVSTAT` onto them (`bcftools annotate --pair-logic exact`).

## Output

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `clinvar/${SAMPLE}_clinvar_hits.vcf` | **The hits: your records that match a ClinVar Pathogenic/Likely_pathogenic allele, with ClinVar's ID, gene (`GENEINFO`), significance (`CLNSIG`) and review status (`CLNREVSTAT`). Your genotype is in the sample column.** |
| `clinvar/${SAMPLE}_pass.vcf.gz` | Filtered, split and left-aligned sample VCF (intermediate) |
| `clinvar/clinvar_pathogenic_chr.norm.vcf.gz` (in `${GENOME_DIR}`) | Normalised ClinVar, shared by every sample |

Both reports (step 24 and `generate-report.sh`) read the hits file and show gene, genotype (het/hom), significance and review status for each hit. Older versions of this step wrote `clinvar/isec/0002.vcf`; that file holds only the sample's side of the intersection, with no gene or significance, and nothing reads it any more. Rerun step 6 to get the hits file.

To list the hits yourself:

```bash
source versions.env   # from the repository root
docker run --rm -v "${GENOME_DIR}:/genome" "${BCFTOOLS_IMAGE}" \
  bcftools query -f '%CHROM:%POS %REF>%ALT [%GT] %INFO/GENEINFO %INFO/CLNSIG %INFO/CLNREVSTAT\n' \
  /genome/${SAMPLE}/clinvar/${SAMPLE}_clinvar_hits.vcf
```

## Interpreting Results

This step screens against **Pathogenic and Likely_pathogenic variants only** — benign and VUS entries are excluded at the database level (see step 00 reference setup). Every hit is an allele that ClinVar classifies as Pathogenic or Likely_pathogenic, and the hit shows your genotype for it.

| Scenario | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Heterozygous + autosomal recessive | Healthy carrier | Note for family planning only |
| Homozygous + autosomal recessive | Possibly affected — requires clinical confirmation | Investigate — confirm with clinical evaluation and ClinVar review status |
| Any genotype + autosomal dominant | Possibly affected — requires clinical confirmation | Investigate — check penetrance, ClinVar review status, and phenotype |
| Compound het (two variants, same gene) | Potentially affected (recessive) | Check if variants are on different alleles (phasing) |

## Limitations

- The reports show ClinVar's review status (`CLNREVSTAT`), but a status such as "criteria provided, single submitter" still rests on one lab. Always check the full ClinVar entry before acting on any result.
- Matching is by allele after both files are split and left-aligned, in the bash script and in the Nextflow module alike. A complex variant that the caller writes differently from ClinVar (for example an MNP against two SNVs) can still be missed.
- The screen sees only small variants in the VCF. Copy-number losses and gene deletions (for example SMN1 in spinal muscular atrophy) are invisible to it.
- Results are **research-grade**, not clinical diagnoses. Do not make medical decisions based solely on this output.

## Important Notes
- Most hits will be **heterozygous carriers of recessive conditions** — this is normal and expected
- A typical 30X WGS shows 0-10 pathogenic/likely pathogenic overlaps. The majority are benign carrier states for recessive conditions
- Focus review on: homozygous pathogenic, any autosomal dominant pathogenic, and compound heterozygous variants in the same gene
- The ClinVar pathogenic database must be chr-prefixed to match the BAM/VCF coordinate system (done in step 00)
- ClinVar is updated monthly — re-download periodically to catch newly classified variants
